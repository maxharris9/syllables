there are heuristics that help you break a word apart by syllables. however, there are tons of exceptions.

(there are phenomeme [look up spelling] databases, like the one from CMU, but this is only useful for _counting_ syllables, not telling you which letters are in which syllables)

let's build a server that:
  - accepts syllable suggestions from users for a given word
  - accepts ratings from users 
  - returns a list of syllable breakdowns, each with a rating
